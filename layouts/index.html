  <h2 class="h1">What we're doing</h2>
  <p>Ballet Street Project is a platform for the creation and development of dance-centered artistic collaborations across all mediums. We seek to unite cultures and communities by recognizing that art lives within everyone of us, and by fostering the development of creative expression through dance. We want to touch hearts through the beauty and inspiration of the performing arts.</p>
  <p>We are currently working on the production of 5 short videos featuring professional ballet dancers in locations all around Kansas City: Union Station, Nelson Atkins Museum, 18th and Vine, the 1900 building and bridges around the West Bottoms and River Market. The dancers are wearing their own clothes and improvising in the moment. We have chosen popular music for mass appeal.</p>

  <h2 class="h1">Union Station</h2>
  <p>Union Station is the first video created by Ballet Street Project.  We unleashed nine professional ballet dancers from months of quarantine, chose five inspiring locations around Union station, blasted Black Pumas from a speaker and started the cameras rolling under the guidance of the experienced Ron Berg.</p>
  <p>The dancers, wearing their own clothes (some donated by Eleve Dancewear) and sneakers, reacted to the moment as best they know how, through movement.  The ‘choreography’ is totally improvised, except for one small section with two boys.  Everyone was a witness to the joy and release the dancers were feeling from getting to move and perform in open space again.</p>
  <p>Mother nature cooperated beautifully, and provided light that painted atmospheric backdrops. The timing of the evening brought us from the bright lights of pre dusk, on the bridge with Lilly and Lamin, into the glow of sunset with James, the colorful drama after the sun just sets with Kelsey, and ending in the mystique and excitement of a night just beginning by the fountain with everyone dancing.</p>
  <p>The final composition was arranged and edited by the talent at Bic Media.</p>
